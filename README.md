# Turret-Lib

turret-lib is a library which provides a turretClient and turretLogger class, which communicate with a turret-server, and can be included in any c++ plugin which needs to resolve shotgun tank uris.  

UTSALA provides two example projects which use turret-lib: turret-usd and turref-klf (katana).
